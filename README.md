# UFOs in California
## A quick exploration into interesting findings from the UFO dataset, limited to the state of California

Description:

Ah yes, UFOs. I remember the day when I first saw War of the Worlds. I must have been 12. I'll never forget it. There was a period in my life where I was so captivated by that movie that I actually kept on replaying the DVD copy I had on loop for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I replayed this movie so much that my Dad got concerned by the fact that Tom Cruise's face was always on the Television screen. Anyways.

This investigation does not comprise Tom Cruise but is about UFO sightings. Specifically, UFO sightings in California. We'll be looking to see where and when UFO sightings occur the most and at which city. In the end, should you decide to live in California and become a UFO hunter, let this article be your guide.

Note: This data article is intended to be a fun investigation and not a serious one. Intepretations are often times purposefully humorous and are both scientifically and inferentially bogus on purpose. Please DO NOT take it seriously. At the current moment I am a beginner data analyst who's just looking to poke some fun with datasets.

The data is extracted from a website called the National UFO Reporting Center. Their dataset is public and can be accessed here: https://nuforc.org/
